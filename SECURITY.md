## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the DoHClient project, please take the following steps:

### Step 1: Contact the Maintainers

- **DO NOT open an issue on GitHub**, as this would publicly disclose the vulnerability.
- Contact the maintainers securely. You can find contact details in the README or, if available, the `MAINTAINERS` file in the repository.

### Step 2: Provide a Detailed Report

- Include as much information as possible to help the maintainers understand the scope and severity of the issue.
- Describe the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if applicable.

### Step 3: Wait for an Acknowledgment

- Please allow a reasonable amount of time for the maintainers to assess and fix the vulnerability.
- We will acknowledge your report within 5 business days and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

### Step 4: Avoid Public Disclosure

- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until the maintainers have fixed it and made an announcement.
- Following the resolution of the issue, you are welcome to disclose it responsibly.

## Policy for Security Updates

Once we receive a vulnerability report:

1. We will assess the vulnerability's impact on the project.
2. If necessary, we will release a security patch and update the affected version.
3. We will publicly disclose the issue after a majority of users have updated to the secure version.

## Credits

People reporting security vulnerabilities will be acknowledged in our project documentation, unless they request to remain anonymous.
